       INTRO & WHY FOCUS (CARDS)

      <!-- Intro text (unchanged) -->
      <p>
        Azure Infrastructure stands at the core of digital transformation, enabling organizations to migrate existing applications,
        accelerate new development, and innovate with advanced technologies like AI. From compute and storage to networking and
        governance, Azure Infrastructure services offer the flexibility, security, and performance you need to run your workloads
        in the cloud or hybrid environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        When combined with the Technical Presales and Deployment (TPD) team’s guidance, you gain a strategic edge: expert insights,
        tailored best practices, and hands‐on support to plan, build, sell, and grow your Azure Infrastructure solutions. Whether
        you’re moving SAP to the cloud, setting up high‐performance computing (HPC), or simply looking to modernize your datacenter
        operations, TPD can help you unlock the full potential of Azure Infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Focus on Azure Infrastructure?</h2>
      <div class="why-focus-cards">
        <!-- 5 bullet points as 5 separate cards -->
        <div class="why-focus-card">
          <h3>1. End‐to‐End Cloud & Hybrid Flexibility</h3>
          <p>
            Azure’s extensive suite of Infrastructure‐as‐a‐Service (IaaS), Platform‐as‐a‐Service (PaaS), 
            and hybrid tools (like Azure Arc and Azure Stack) ensures you can run virtually any workload—
            on‐premises, in the cloud, or at the edge.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-focus-card">
          <h3>2. Unparalleled Security & Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            From Network Security Groups to Azure Firewall, Azure Policy, and built‐in encryption features,
            Azure Infrastructure is designed with security at its core—essential for meeting regulatory 
            requirements and safeguarding data.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-focus-card">
          <h3>3. Performance at Scale</h3>
          <p>
            Azure’s global footprint and specialized VM families (N‐Series, H‐Series) enable 
            high‐performance computing scenarios that were once cost‐prohibitive or too complex 
            to manage on‐premises.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-focus-card">
          <h3>4. Cost Optimization & Governance</h3>
          <p>
            Tools like Azure Cost Management, Azure Advisor, and Azure Resource Manager help you 
            right‐size resources and maintain financial visibility—all crucial for a successful 
            cloud practice.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-focus-card">
          <h3>5. Rapid Innovation with AI & Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            By leveraging the connectivity and integrated services within Azure, you can easily attach
            advanced AI or data analytics solutions to your infrastructure, delivering insights and
            unlocking new business models.
