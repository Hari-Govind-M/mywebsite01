            <p>We tailor each engagement according to your needs, following a four-phase approach:</p>
            <div class="card-grid">
                <!-- Card 1: Plan -->
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Plan</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Discovery & Assessment:</strong> Evaluate your current environment—on-prem, cloud, or hybrid—to identify technical gaps and AI opportunities.</li>
                        <li><strong>High-Level Architecture:</strong> Determine the best approach (rehost, refactor, rearchitect, or greenfield) and align solution areas with your business goals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Roadmap:</strong> Create a clear project roadmap so all stakeholders understand the project scope, timeline, and desired outcomes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A mid-sized ISV wants to migrate a legacy .NET app to Azure while integrating AI. After assessing on-prem VMs and databases, we outline a plan to rehost certain components and refactor others for containers, detailing how Azure Cognitive Services can enhance the user experience.</p>

                        <li><strong>Technical Architecture & Deployment:</strong> Our PTCs guide best practices around networking, security, identity, and data—ensuring a future-proof environment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proof-of-Concept & Pilot:</strong> Validate key workloads, AI prototypes, or performance metrics in a controlled environment before scaling up.</li>
                        <li><strong>Knowledge Transfer:</strong> We coach your teams on resource management, DevOps processes, and monitoring so you’re self-sufficient after the engagement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You modernize a data analytics platform with Azure Synapse, Data Lake, and Power BI. A small proof-of-concept with historical sales data paves the way for full-scale AI-driven forecasting.</p>

                        <li><strong>Technical Presales Demos:</strong> Showcase real-world scenarios—like AI-based image recognition—that directly address your customers’ business challenges.</li>
                        <li><strong>Competitive Positioning & Objection Handling:</strong> Leverage our deep Microsoft expertise to counter concerns about solution complexity or cost.</li>
                        <li><strong>ROI/TCO Analysis:</strong> Develop robust, data-driven business cases to illustrate the benefits of cloud transformation, AI adoption, or workload consolidation.</li>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A partner competes to deploy Microsoft 365 for a global manufacturing client. We help create a Teams + Microsoft 365 Copilot demo that emphasizes streamlined workflow, AI-assisted productivity, and reduced IT overhead.</p>

                        <li><strong>Advanced Feature Adoption:</strong> Explore additional services (machine learning, data analytics, IoT) to drive ongoing innovation and revenue growth.</li>
