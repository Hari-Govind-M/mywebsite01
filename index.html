                <li><strong>Data & AI (Azure):</strong> Modernize data platforms with Azure SQL, Azure Synapse, or Data Lake. Implement advanced analytics, machine learning, or cognitive services for intelligent applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital & App Innovation (Azure):</strong> Develop cloud-native apps using microservices, serverless architectures, and DevOps. Enrich solutions with AI capabilities and publish to the Microsoft commercial marketplace.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Protect identities, endpoints, and data with Microsoft Entra (Azure AD), Microsoft Defender, and Zero Trust architecture. Utilize Microsoft Sentinel for AI-assisted threat detection and automated response.</li>
                <li><strong>Modern Work:</strong> Deploy Microsoft 365, Teams, SharePoint, and AI-driven tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot to enhance collaboration. Establish governance, compliance, and user adoption best practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Applications:</strong> Elevate customer engagement with Dynamics 365 (Sales, Customer Service, Marketing) and the Power Platform. Embed AI for predictive insights and personalized experiences (e.g., Microsoft Sales Copilot).</li>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Our Engagement Model: Plan – Build – Sell – Grow</h2>
            <p>We tailor each engagement according to your needs, following a four-phase approach:</p>
            <div class="engagement-phase">
                <h3>1. Plan</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Discovery & Assessment:</strong> Evaluate your current environment—on-prem, cloud, or hybrid—to identify technical gaps and AI opportunities.</li>
                    <li><strong>High-Level Architecture:</strong> Determine the best approach (rehost, refactor, rearchitect, or greenfield) and align solution areas (infrastructure, data, AI) with your business goals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Roadmap:</strong> Create a clear project roadmap so all stakeholders understand the project scope, timeline, and desired outcomes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A mid-sized ISV wants to migrate a legacy .NET app to Azure while integrating AI. After assessing on-prem VMs and databases, we outline a plan to rehost certain components and refactor others for containers, detailing how Azure Cognitive Services can enhance the user experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="engagement-phase">
                <h3>2. Build</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Architecture & Deployment:</strong> Our PTCs guide best practices around networking, security, identity, and data—ensuring a future-proof environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proof-of-Concept & Pilot:</strong> Validate key workloads, AI prototypes, or performance metrics in a controlled environment before scaling up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge Transfer:</strong> We coach your teams on resource management, DevOps processes, and monitoring so you’re self-sufficient after the engagement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You modernize a data analytics platform with Azure Synapse, Data Lake, and Power BI. A small proof-of-concept with historical sales data paves the way for full-scale AI-driven forecasting.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="engagement-phase">
                <h3>3. Sell</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Technical Presales Demos:</strong> Showcase real-world scenarios—like AI-based image recognition—that directly address your customers’ business challenges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Competitive Positioning & Objection Handling:</strong> Leverage our deep Microsoft expertise to counter concerns about solution complexity or cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>ROI/TCO Analysis:</strong> Develop robust, data-driven business cases to illustrate the benefits of cloud transformation, AI adoption, or workload consolidation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A partner competes to deploy Microsoft 365 for a global manufacturing client. We help create a Teams + Microsoft 365 Copilot demo that emphasizes streamlined workflow, AI-assisted productivity, and reduced IT overhead.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="engagement-phase">
                <h3>4. Grow</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Post-Deployment Optimization:</strong> Adopt continuous best practices for performance, scalability, governance, and compliance—crucial for expanding AI workloads.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Feature Adoption:</strong> Explore additional services (machine learning, data analytics, IoT) to drive ongoing innovation and revenue growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Co-Sell & Marketplace Alignment:</strong> If you’re a Microsoft partner, we can help align your solution for co-sell and commercial marketplace exposure.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> After migrating to Azure, a retailer wants to integrate IoT sensors for predictive maintenance. We help with Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Machine Learning for real-time anomaly detection, turning initial success into a broader advanced solution offering.</p>
